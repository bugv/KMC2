"""This module contains the functions related to frequency calculations

It contains functions to initially attribute a frequency to hops with different types of atoms 
and to calculate the frequency of given events

Available functions:
- frequency_calculator
- standardize_frequencies
- hop frequency_calculator
- select_event (slow, should not be used)
- select_event_alternative (fast, prefered version)
- random_number
- time_step_calcualtor (slow, should not be used)
- time_step_calculator_alternative (fast, preered alternative)
